HTML Structure:

The code is wrapped inside the <html> tags, indicating that it is an HTML document.
The <head> section contains various metadata and external resource links.
The <body> section contains the visible content of the web page.
Metadata and External Resources:

The <meta> tag sets the character encoding of the document to UTF-8.
The <link> tags are used to include external resources.
The first two <link> tags are used to import fonts from Google Fonts.
The third <link> tag imports a CSS file named "todo.css" for styling.
The fourth <link> tag imports the Font Awesome icon library for additional icons.
Page Content:

The <div class="container"> element acts as a container for the entire content of the web page.
The <h1> heading displays the title "To-Do List."
The <div class="input-section"> contains the input elements for adding tasks.
An <input> element with the id "taskInput" allows users to enter a task.
A <select> element with the id "prioritySelect" provides options to select the task priority.
The <button> element with the id "addTaskBtn" triggers the addition of a new task.
The <ul id="taskList"> represents an unordered list where the tasks will be displayed.
Script:

The <script> tag includes a JavaScript file named "dojss.js" which contains the logic for handling the To-Do List functionality.
Overall, this code sets up the structure, styling, and functionality for a To-Do List web page where users can input tasks, assign priorities, and see the tasks listed dynamically. The JavaScript file, "dojss.js," likely handles tasks such as capturing user input, adding tasks to the list, and managing task priorities.
